                        I'am Amrullah Azzaky, a student at Universitas Lampung, 
                        Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, majoring in Computer Science with a 
                        focus on Informatic Management (D3). Currently, I am focusing on developing my skills in Information Technology (IT) and graphic design, 
                        both of which are my key areas of interest. Through my formal education, I have gained a solid understanding of IT principles, software development, 
                        and data management, while my passion for graphic design allows me to approach technology with a creative and aesthetic perspective.

                    <p>
                        I believe that learning is a continuous process, and I am always striving to improve my skills—both 
                        through formal education at university and practical experiences outside of campus. 
                        I am open to collaboration opportunities and eager to contribute to projects that combine technology and creativity. 
                        With a strong passion for continuous growth, I look forward to collaborating with other professionals in the field and building meaningful connections throughout my career journey.
